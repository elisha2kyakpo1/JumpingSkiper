# phaser3-RPG game
In this project, I have built a browser game using the phaser game engine. Phaser is an HTML5 game framework that aims to help developers make powerful, cross-browser HTML5 games really quickly. It's a Microverse capstone project, and this time I was required to create a game to put into practice the ES6, Webpack, promises, JSON data, and functional programming. Users can play this game in the browser by using keyboard arrow keys.
